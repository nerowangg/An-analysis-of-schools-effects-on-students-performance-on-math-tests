#Overview

This repo contains code and data for affect performance on math tests for school students. The purpose is to create a report that summarises the results of a statistical model that we built. Some data is unable to be shared publicly. We detail how to get that below.

The data sets are not included in the repo but could be found easily. We use two datasets:
The data source comes from  the school's leaver data which could be found in the URL https://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/data-services/national/school_leavers where we can also find details of information of the raw data. And however, a simpler version of was used in this study which could be found in the http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/ which is in individual student level of math score performance.
Rmd, PDF files are main outcomes of the study which include our studies on the topicmodels::
